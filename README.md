# Student-Stack-Overflow

StudentStackOverflow is a website where students can post questions about their university modules. It was developed using PHP/MySQL .

To run this application you will need to run an Apache server , using XAMPP or any other platform that provides this functionality.

The MySQL database file is located in the foldewr DATABASE , which you need to import in a database management tool such as phpMyAdmin (which is the one I used)
